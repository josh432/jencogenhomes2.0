        <h4>Deciding to Purchase</h4>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Purchasing a property is most likely the biggest financial decision you'll ever make. Whether this is your first purchase or you are an experienced buyer, this decision should be made carefully.</p>
        <h4>What Are Your Buying Goals?</h4>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Are you tired of paying rent? Do you want to pay for your own mortgage instead of your landlord's? Have you outgorwn your current home? Are you looking for an investment which will generate rental income? Would you rather live in a different area? Do you need a larger yard? Do you need a shorter commute? Knowing your reasons for buying will help you choose the right property.</p>
        <h4>Has Your Income Grown?</h4>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Property ownership is an excellent investment; whether you are looking for your dream home, a rental property, or to expand your investment portfolio. Owning real estate is one of the least risky ways to build equity or to obtain a greater return on your initial investment.</p>
        <h4>Preparing To Buy</h4>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Before you start shopping for your property, it is a good idea to make some preparations.</p>
        <h5>Build Your Financial Profile</h5>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Your financial profile contains all your important financial documents if you will need it to secure financing for your property. The typical financial profile should contain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Financial Statements</li>
          <li>Bank Accounts</li>
          <li>Investments</li>
          <li>Credit Cards</li>
          <li>Auto loans</li>
          <li>Recent pay stubs</li>
          <li>Tax Returns for two years</li>
          <li>Copies of leases for investment properties</li>
          <li>401K statements, life insurance, stocks, bonds, and mutual account information</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Check Your Credit Rating</h5>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Your credit score will have a huge impact on what type of property you can buy, and at what price. It is first recommended to check your credit rating with an experienced lending institution so that we can determine what you can afford. The lender will research your credit ratings from the three credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. We will be happy to recommend experienced, knowledgeable lenders in the residential, construction, and commercial and investment real estate fields.</p>
        <h5>Be Careful With Your Finances</h5>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
        Now is not a good time to make sudden career changes or large purchases. You want to approach your property purchase from a position of financial stability. In other words, do not apply for loan and change jobs or retire.<br><br>                             
        Do not brake any large purchases or move monies to new or “unseasoned” (less then 2 months) accounts.</p>
        <h5>Choosing A Real Estate Agent</h5>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Buying a property requires making many important financial decisions, understanding complex issues and completing a lot of paperwork. It helps to have an expert in your corner when undertaking such a large purchase. We can guide you through this process, and also provide you with access to property listings before they hit the general market.<br><br>
        Here are some factors to consider when choosing your real estate professional:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look for a full-time agent – one who has experience completing transactions similar to yours.</li>
          <li>Interview a few agents: Are they familiar with the area in which you are interested?</li>
          <li>Ask how much time the agent will have for you, and if they are available at night and on weekends.</li>
          <li>Ask about their credentials and education: A good agent will continually strive to improve and gain knowledge of the latest real estate trends and hold the highest designations in their respective fields of expertise.</li>
          <li>Does the agent return your calls promptly? Time is money when attempting to buy a property.</li>
          <li>Ask for a list of properties they have sold or a list of references.</li>
          <li>Choose an agent who listens attentively to your needs and concerns. Pick an agent, with whom you feel comfortable.</li><br><br>
          <h4>Time To Go Shopping</h4>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Once those preparations are out of the way, it is time to decide the right property for you</p>
          <h5>Take A Drive</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Get to know the neighborhoods, compounds, or subdivisions, which interest you. Drive around get a feel for what it would be like to own a property in the area. Start getting a sense of the properties available in those areas.<br><br>
          Drive areas of interest at different times of day to see if there are any factors that will affect your enjoyment.</p>
          <h5>Narrow Your Search</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Select a few properties that interest you the most and contact us to make appointments to visit them. Ask your real estate agent about the potential long term resale value of the properties you are considering.</p>
          <h5>Time To Buy</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Once you have picked out the property you want to purchase, we are here to help you make an offer that the seller will accept. A good broker will investigate the potential costs and expenses associated with the new property. Our goal is to help you draft your offer in a way that gives you the advantage over another offer.</p><br>
          <h4>Escrow Inspections and Appraisals</h4>
          <h5>The Process, Step-by-Step</h5>
          <h5>The Initial Agreement and Deposit.</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          An effective agreement is a legal arrangement between a potential purchaser and the property’s seller.</p>
          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
          Some important tips to keep in mind to streamline the process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep written records of everything. For the sake of clarity, it will be extremely useful to transcribe all verbal agreements including counter-offers and addendums and to convert them into written agreements to be signed by both parties. We will assist you in drafting all the paperwork for your purchase and make sure that you have copies of everything.</li><br>
            <li>Stick to the schedule. Now that you have chosen your offer, you and the seller will be given a timeline to mark every stage in the process of closing the real estate contract. Meeting the requirements on time ensures a smoother flow of negotiations so that each party involved is not in breach of their agreements. During the process, we will keep you constantly updated, so you will always be prepared for the next step.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 900">The Closing Agent.</span><span class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> Either a title company or an attorney will be selected as a closing agent. The closing agent will hold the deposit in escrow and will research the complete recorded history of the property to ensure that the title is free and clear of encumbrances by the date of closing and that all new encumbrances are properly added to the title. Some properties are subject to restrictions which limit various activities such as a building or parking restrictions. There may be recorded easements and encroachments, which limit the rights to use your property.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: 900">How to Hold Title.</span><span class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> You may wish to consult an attorney or tax advisor on the best way to hold the title. Different methods of holding title have different legal, estate and tax implications, especially when selling or upon the death of the title holder.</span></p>

             <p><span style="font-weight: 900">Inspections.</span><span class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> Once your offer is accepted by the seller, you will need to have a licensed property inspector inspect the property within the time frame that was agreed upon in the effective contract to purchase. You may elect to have different inspectors inspect the property if you wish to obtain professional opinions from inspectors who specialize in a specific area (eg. roof, HVAC, structure). If you are purchasing a commercial property, then you will need to have an environmental audit done on the site for the lending institution. We can recommend several different inspectors.<br><br>
             Depending on the outcome of these inspections, one of two things may happen:</span></p>

             <ol>
              <li>Either each milestone is successfully closed and the contingencies will be removed, bringing you one step closer to the close, or</li>
              <li>The buyer, after reviewing the property and the papers, requests a renegotiation of the terms of the contract (usually the price).</li>
            </ol>
